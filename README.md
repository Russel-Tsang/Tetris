# Tetris

## Background and Overview
Tetris is a classic tile-based video game that has since evolved into more high-speed and feature-filled versions. However, initial foundations are still there:

* game pieces, or "tetriminoes", are randomly dropped onto a grid-based board
* lines are cleared by complete filling a row 
* speed of single-player mode increases as the player clears more lines 
* player loses when pieces fill up to the top of the field

## Functionality and MVP Features
Users will be able to
* start, pause, and restart the simulation
* drop tetriminoes slowly (soft-drop) or instantly (hard-drop)


## Architectures and Technologies 
* Vanilla JS to simulate piece movement and overall game logic
* Webpack to bundle various and execute scripts
* Library (undecided as of right now) to implement sound
